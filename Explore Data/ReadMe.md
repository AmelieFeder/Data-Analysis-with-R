# Explore mineralogical data

This file shows part of my data exploration process of my mineralogical data. The data was derived by XRD analysis and is stored in a SQL database. Prior to storing it, the data was already cleaned. However, it contains zeroâ€™s as it is possible for some minerals to not occur in some samples.

The data has the following structure:
|SampleId|Facies|Mineral1   |Mineral2
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Sample1|Facies1|#Value|#Value|


### Workflow
First, I establish a connection with the database and load the XRD data formatted as a data frame into R. The data frame contains a lot of columns with zero or very low values (mineral contents). These accessory minerals are not the focus of my analysis, so they are aggregated to mineral groups. 

A quick overview plot was used to get a general sense of the data.
